<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  This creamy vegan pasta is my favorite recipe to make when I’m craving comfort
  food but don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen. From start to finish, it
  takes just over 20 minutes to make, so it’s the perfect weeknight meal. All
  you need to do is boil the pasta, blend up the sauce, sauté onion and
  broccoli, and toss it all together. Then, you can sit down to devour warm
  bowls of noodles and veggies coated with this super creamy vegan pasta sauce.
  While this sauce looks like a rich cream or cheese sauce, it’s actually a
  tangy, luscious blend of white beans, lemon juice, and nutritional yeast. So
  this recipe is not only quick & comforting, but it’s also healthy!

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Make the sauce: In a blender, combine the white beans, broth, lemon juice,
      olive oil, nutritional yeast, garlic, onion powder, salt, and pepper, and
      blend until smooth. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the pasta according
      to the instructions on the package, cooking until al dente. Drain and set
      aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
      the onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in the chopped broccoli stems and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes or
      until tender. Add the broccoli florets and leaves and a splash of water or
      vegetable broth. Cover and turn off the heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow the broccoli to steam for 2 to 3 minutes or until tender but still
      bright green. Add the pasta, then stir in ¾ of the sauce, adding more
      broth if the sauce is too dry.
    </li>
    <li>
      Season to taste with more salt, pepper and lemon juice, as desired, and
      portion into bowls. Divide the remaining sauce onto each bowl. Top with
      the pine nuts and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
    </li>
  </ol>
