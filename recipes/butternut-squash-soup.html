<h3>Description</h3>
<p>My favorite fall tradition is making butternut squash soup on Sunday afternoons. On a brisk day, there’s nothing more soothing than chopping and simmering vegetables over a warm stove. As you cook, the kitchen fills with the cozy scent of sage, rosemary, and butternut squash, and when you’re finished, steaming bowls of butternut squash soup (that will last all week!) reward you for your work.</p>

	<h4>Ingredients</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
		<li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
		<li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
		<li>1 (3-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
		<li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>

	<h4>Steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, salt, and several grinds of fresh pepper and sauté until soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the squash and cook until it begins to soften, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add the garlic, sage, rosemary, and ginger. Stir and cook 30 seconds to 1 minute, until fragrant, then add 3 cups of the broth. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until the squash is tender, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Let cool slightly and pour the soup into a blender, working in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth. If your soup is too thick, add up to 1 cup more broth and blend. Season to taste and serve with parsley, pepitas, and crusty bread.</li>
	</ol>
