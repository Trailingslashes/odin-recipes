<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  This coconut curry recipe is everything I want on a weeknight. Scratch that –
  it’s everything I want… any time. I’ve been eating it as leftovers for lunch,
  dinner… I even ate a bowlful for breakfast the other day. The recipe is
  particularly Monday night-friendly because it’s quick to make yet packs a
  punch of flavor. It’s filled with cozy, nourishing vegetables that will help
  you recover from a weekend of fun.

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and
      cook until soft and well-browned, about 10 minutes, reducing the heat to
      low halfway through.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander,
      turmeric, cardamom, and salt. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the butternut squash and chiles to the pot, stir, and cook for 5
      minutes. Stir in the cauliflower and then add the coconut milk and the
      spice mixture. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are
      tender.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the lemon juice, lime juice, spinach, peas, and stir. Taste and adjust
      seasonings, adding additional lime juice, salt, and pepper, as desired.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve the curry over the rice with fresh basil, naan bread, if desired,
      and lime wedges on the side.
    </li>
